Welcome to my writing porfolio!

You can review my writing samples here. This README file contains links to samples from Nylas, Informatica, and Bluecat Networks. 

## Nylas

I was the owner of the quickstart guides and spearheaded the initiative of improving them. The sample below is a quickstart guide that contains instructions on how to set up an application and make the initial API call.

Grants are the most important objects in Nylas. The sample below is a topic that I worked on about bulk authentication grants.

## Informatica

I worked on several documentation projects at Informatica. The sample below is a topic about Operational Insights, a feature that was introduced in 2024 that allows customers to view data processing analytics and monitoring statistics for MDM SaaS business applications.

## Bluecat Networks

At Bluecat Networks, I managed administration guides, API documentation, deployment guides, and release notes. A big project I worked on was documenting a new feature called Identity and Access Management. This feature allows customers to leverage SAML-based Web Single Sign-On (SSO) and OAuth API authorization in Address Manager, Bluecat's admin console. The first sample is a link to the main topic and the second sample is a link to a topic about OAuth API authorization.
